      <h1 style="padding-top: 24px;">Problem</h1>
      <p>Mailchimp needed to update its revenue model to match an expanding product suite. I led the design-research effort that informed how we would go on to display our product merchandising to our customers. </p>
      <p>Mailchimp's product suite matured tremendously since its founding in 2000, but its pricing structure remained exactly the same. By the time my team was tasked with implementing the improved revenue model, our customers were getting a bargain on the product ‚Äî but they didn't always know what they were paying for.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="photo-1up" src="https://file.notion.so/f/s/b13d83a7-2a9b-4c33-92b5-d22bfc87423f/Untitled.png?id=5d363064-be5c-478b-941c-4b898f899cf9&table=block&spaceId=e52e538d-e52b-4f44-b1b3-ed13070d14b8&expirationTimestamp=1690495200000&signature=KjxAExzYK_8rhEhPKLj4eJ8LhNgygPFOoQuM0ZOyuUI&downloadName=Untitled.png">
        <figcaption>Mailchimp's Pricing Page as of 2017 touted what appears to be a simple 3-tiered suite of plans, but look closer, and you'll see that the "Growing Businesses" tier can span a huge price range, and the "Pro" plan is actually an annual add-on.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <p>In-app, Mailchimp's monthly plan was just called ‚ÄúMonthly‚Äù because it was a plan that required a monthly payment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free:</strong>  Mailchimp's incredibly robust base plan. Most everyone started out with a free plan, then scaled to Monthly if they needed</li>
      <li><strong>Growing Business/Monthly:</strong> Mailchimp's paid offering. You could pay us if you had more than 2,000 customers
          <ul>
            <li>Copy beneath label: ‚ÄúA once-per-month charge based on the highest number of subscribers and transactional recipients in your account during a 30-day billing period‚Äù</li>
          </ul>
      <li><strong>Pro Marketer:</strong> an annual add-on that allowed customers to access some premium features, like comparative reports and white glove support. In this truly bizarre revenue structure, it was possible for a customer to be both ‚ÄúFree‚Äù and ‚ÄúPro‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not shown on the pricing page was the Pay As You Go plan, a specialty product intended for one-time bulk senders.</p>
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p>The new pricing model added a lot of complexity for our customers to understand. As with any new features, there was going to be a learning curve as customers learned about the new pricing model. We wanted to ensure that as our pricing model expanded, we added clarity over complexity.</p>
    <p>This update to our pricing structure was also concurrent with a top-down refresh to Mailchimp's  <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_mailchimp_by_collins_and_in_house.php">lovable brand</a>. As I considered improvements to the functionality of this page, I also worked closely with the working team that was nailing down the specifics of our new patterns, color palettes, and components.</p>

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>We conducted research iteratively throughout the entire 6-month design-build process. I worked closely with our in-house UX Researchers to ensure that we were asking the right questions.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>At the end of 2 rounds of user testing with customers and several tech spec talks with engineers, we landed on a page where the customer would make two decisions in sequence:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> <strong>Select your plan:</strong> Because different plans accommodate different ranges in the number of contacts, a slider loaded dynamically according to which plan was selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Select your contact tier:</strong> As the customer adjusts the slider, the estimated monthly price updates accordingly.</li>
  </ol>
  
  This is how customers adjust their plan details in Mailchimp today. It's a far cry from the sweet little quasi-3-tiered system that was in place before, and it's been a critical step in scaling the business.</p>
